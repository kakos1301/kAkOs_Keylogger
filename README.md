# Kακός_Keylogger
I am working on a project to simulate a keylogger with some level of persistence. The goal is to inject the executable into the autorun registry setting. This will allow the keylogger to start automatically every time the system boots up. By doing this, the keylogger can record all keystrokes made on the system.

## Execution

Navigate to (https://git-scm.com/downloads) and download Git for Windows.
```
Open the command prompt. You do not need to "Run as Administrator".

Change directory to C:\

From C:\>
C:\>git clone https://github.com/kakos1301/kAkOs_Keylogger.git

C:\>cd kAkOs_Keylogger

C:\>keylogger.bat

Reboot the Windows 10 system
```

## Test

```
Change directory to C:\>kAkOs_Keylogger\
